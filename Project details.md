# PDF Merger Tool for Chrome Extension

## Overview
Develop a PDF Merger tool as part of a Document & Image Toolkit Chrome extension. The tool should allow users to combine multiple PDF files into a single document directly within their browser.

## Key Features
1. User Interface:
   - Clean, intuitive design with a drag-and-drop area
   - List view of added PDF files
   - Options to add more files or remove selected files
   - "Merge and Download" button
   - "Go Back" button to return to the main toolkit interface

2. File Handling:
   - Accept PDF files via drag-and-drop
   - Allow file selection through a traditional file input
   - Validate that only PDF files are accepted
   - Display a list of added files with file names

3. PDF Processing:
   - Use pdf-lib library for PDF manipulation
   - Merge multiple PDF files into a single document
   - Preserve original page order from each PDF
   - Handle potential errors during the merging process

4. Output:
   - Generate a merged PDF file
   - Provide immediate download of the merged PDF
   - Assign a default name (e.g., "merged.pdf") to the output file

5. Navigation:
   - Implement a "Go Back" function to return to the main toolkit interface (sidepanel.html)
   - Ensure smooth transition between the main view and PDF Merger tool view

6. Error Handling and User Feedback:
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid file types
   - Alert users if fewer than two PDFs are selected for merging
   - Display loading indicators during the merging process
   - Show success message after successful merge and download

7. Chrome Extension Integration:
   - Ensure compatibility with Chrome extension architecture
   - Use appropriate Chrome APIs for navigation and file handling if necessary

## Technical Considerations
- Use JavaScript for core functionality
- Incorporate pdf-lib library for PDF manipulation
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
- Optimize performance for handling large PDF files
- Follow Chrome extension best practices and security guidelines

## User Experience Goals
- Simplify the process of merging PDFs for users
- Provide a seamless, in-browser solution without requiring external software
- Offer clear visual feedback throughout the merging process
- Ensure the tool is accessible and easy to use for all skill levels

## Future Enhancements
- Add option to rearrange page order before merging
- Implement PDF preview functionality
- Allow basic PDF editing (e.g., delete pages, rotate pages) before merging
- Expand to support other document types (e.g., combine PDFs with image files)

This prompt encapsulates the core functionality, technical requirements, and user experience goals for the PDF Merger tool within your Chrome extension. It can be used as a reference for development, testing, or explaining the project to stakeholders or other developers.
